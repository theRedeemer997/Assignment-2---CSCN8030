## CSCN8030 – Assignment 2

## Rapid Prototyping With and Without Generative AI Tools

---

## Project Overview

Hospitals face major challenges in managing Operating Room (OR) schedules due to unpredictable surgery durations, emergencies, and growing backlogs.  
This project uses AI to **predict actual surgery duration** based on booked time, service type, and other operational features.

Two AI prototypes were built and compared:

1. **Prototype A – Without Generative AI**

   - Traditional machine learning pipeline
   - Features: `Booked Time (min)`, `Service`, `OR Suite`
   - Model: `RandomForestRegressor`

2. **Prototype B – With Generative AI**
   - Incorporates _Generative-AI-assisted_ feature engineering and synthetic data augmentation
   - Added features: `weekday`, `month`, `is_morning`, `setup_minutes`, `exit_minutes`
   - Uses synthetic “long-surgery” samples inspired by AI-assisted data expansion
